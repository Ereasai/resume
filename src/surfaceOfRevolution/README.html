        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This is a simple program for creating a <b>surface of revolution</b>, defined by the 4 curve options from the original assignment. The program is able to view only one shape at a time and define one curve at a time. It does not have capabilities to export the vertex/normal data. The focus for me on this extra credit portion was to create a <b>nicely rendered image</b> of the surface of revolution, rather than packing a lot of features. I did not look at other resources for finding normals or surface of revolution; the details have been resolved by myself.

        <h3>Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Surface of Revolution</b>: The user can define a curve in the curve editing window. Upon updating the curve, the program will then generate an 3D model of the surface of revolution on the 3D Model window. The surface is revolved around the y-axis.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Viewing</b>: The user can use their mouse to manipulate the camera of the 3D Model window. Supports zoom and rotation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sharp Edge Detection</b>: The models may have sharp edges which should be displayed as a sharp edge, rather than interpolating the normals across it. The user has the option to set a threshold to display sharp edges as a sharp edge for a more realistic preview.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions + Controls</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Open the Visual Studios project located at <code>hw-curves/hw-curves.sln</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press F5, or click the run button on top. Two windows should pop up.
            </li>
            <li>
                The window on the left is the <b>Curve Edit Window</b>. This is where you will define your curve. The axis of rotation is the <b>left edge</b> of your screen. The curve options are (press key while focused on the window):
                <ul>
                    <li>Lines: 0</li>
                    <li>Bezier: 1</li>
                    <li>B-spline: 2</li>
                    <li>Recursive Bezier: 3</li>
                    <li>levelOfDetail (increase/decrease detail): +/- </li>
                </ul>
                <b>Warning:</b> The curve <b>MUST BE</b> defined top to bottom, or the normals will be off!
            </li>
            <li>
                The window on the right is the <b>3D Model Window</b>. 
                This is where your surface of revolution will be previewed. 
                Note that the first and the last point of the curve is extended to the y-axis, hence the flat top and bottom.
                You can manipulate the view by dragging your mouse.
                
                Controls:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rotate: Left Click + Drag </li>
                    <li>Zoom: Right Click + Drag Up/Down</li>
                    <li>Reset View: R</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Warning:</b> There is a bug where upon updating the curve <code>levelOfDetail</code>, the polygon will not be updated until the next change in <code>levelOfDetail</code>. This issue is discussed in the documentation page.
            </li>
            <li>
                To adjust shader and other various settings, go to top of <code>main.cpp</code> (around line 40). 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><code>RESOLUTION</code></b>: Defines how many subdivisions of angles will be used to construct the model, e.g. if <code>RESOLUTION = 10</code>, then points on the curve will be rotated by increments of 36 degrees, 10 times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><code>ACCOUNT_FOR_SHARP_EDGE</code></b>: If set to <code>true</code>, sharp edges will be created if the cosine of the angle at the vertex is below <code>sharp_edge_thereshold</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><code>sharp_edge_thereshold</code></b>: Threshold angle to define when sharp edges should be created. Only relevant if <code>ACCOUNT_FOR_SHARP_EDGE</code> is enabled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><code>SHADER_IN</code></b>, <b><code>SHADER_IN_SHININESS</code></b>: Material properties and light setting. A point light is placed at the camera (kind of like pointing at the origin with a flashlight).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            The program can be easily extended to support multiple curves and multiple surfaces at once. Due to other courses, it is hard to put in all of my energy into this assignment. It seems like resolving the polygon construction part of a modeling software is the hardest part.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In my vision, the program can have multiple VBO, EBO, NBO to store different polygons generated by different curves.</li>
            <li>There will be two display options in the 3D Modeling window: one for seeing each surface defined by a curve, and one for composing all of the models into one scene. More control will be added to the 3D Modeling window to allow for transformation of the selected surface. One will be able to instantiate multiple instances of the same surface.</li>
            <li>There will be a list of objects, 1) each corresponding to a surface generated by one of the curve, 2) a transformation stack corresponding to this instance of the surface, and 3) material properties for the shader.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This was a very fun and challenging assignment.

        <ul>
            <li>Added second window.</li>
            <li>Successful redisplay of the Curve Editor window in a separate

        <h1 id="section-1">2/24</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Curve::draw()</code> now takes
                <code>Pvector &amp; discreteCurvePoints</code>, which can be updated
                with discrete points evaluated by each of the respective
                <code>Curve::draw()</code> functions.
            </li>
            <li>This vector is used to construct the solid in the 3D display
                window.</li>

        <h1 id="section-2">2/25</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Phong shader added, only supports one light source coming out of the
                eye.</li>
            <li>NBO, EBO, VBO added (there is a ‘3D’ suffix in the code).</li>
            <li>Callbacks are intercepted to update the 3D shape. For instance,
                changing <code>levelOfDetail</code> reloads the shape.</li>
            <li>Surface of revolution complete! However, a lot of vertices are
                redundant. Furthermore, the normals are not interpolated correctly (more
                info on the algorithm after the following bullet points).
                <ul>
                    <li>rewrite <code>reloadShape()</code> to use vertices that have been
                        already added.</li>
                    <li>only run <code>reloadShape()</code> when it is really required.
                        Specifically, when the user is done editing the curve.</li>

        <h2 id="initial-naive-revolution-algorithm">Initial (Naive) Revolution
            Algorithm</h2>
        A quick naive approach to generate the solid. Take
        <code>discreteCurvePoints</code> updated by each of the curve algorithm,
        and simply rotate around the y-axis. I saw the opportunity to reuse a
        lot of data, that is, to only put a <strong>vertical strip</strong> of
        the object into the buffer and simply draw the full object using
        <code>Transform::rotate()</code>.

            <img src="./documentation/initial_revolution_algorithm/diagram.png" alt="curve and shape generated from the inital algorithm" width="600" />
        </center>
        For my particular implementation, I only iterate once to get the vertical strip into the shader, then it is drawn multiple times with a different <code>modelview</code> matrix.
        Here is the result:

            Approach</h3>
        <p>Clearly, the object rendered on the screen doesn’t look smooth at
            all. It may make sense for it to look sharp on the horizontal edges, but
            vertical edges should be smooth as it was “revolved”.</p>
        <p>The fix to this problem was quite straightfoward; the algorithm had
            to use shared vertices. This, I believe, meant that I could not simply
            save a <strong>vertical strip</strong> of the shape and reuse it to draw
            the full solid. Hence, the next algorithm will account for the faults of
            this algorithm.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>the 3D shape will only update when the curve is modified + mouse is
                release.
                <ul>
                    <li>had to change <code>glutMouseFunc()</code> callback function for the
                        curves window to run both <code>scene.mouse()</code> and
                        <code>reloadShape()</code> function, which will set the buffers for the
                        new updated shape.
                    </li>
                    <li>increased performance!!!</li>

        Instead of creating separate vertices for each of the edges of the
        triangle, share the vertices. Hence, the rotated discrete points are
        only added once to the buffer. All of the vertices of the whole object
        is added to the buffer. The result is a much more smooth render of the
        object. Here are some images:

        </center>
        <p>Even with reletively small <code>levelOfDetail</code> on the curve,
            the object generated appears smooth (the normals are being
            interpolated).</p>

        <h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>
        <p>There are some problems with the normals. On sharp edges, the normals
            should not be interpolated. When the normals are interpolated between
            two faces that are connected by a sharp edge, it creates a very weird
            image. This issue is discussed more in the next section.</p>

        <h2 id="forced-sharp-edges-mode-0">Forced Sharp Edges (Mode 0)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some models might require shape edges, like when option 0 (lines)
                are used to create the curve. <em>Here is an example:</em>
                <center>
                    <img src="./documentation/forced_sharp_edges/curve.png" alt="curve" width="300" />

                </center>
            </li>
            <li>You can see that the bottom and top part of the figure does not
                display the visually “correct” normals.</li>

        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>In line curve mode (option 0), each vertex is created three times to
                allow sharp normals (this obviously isn’t the best solution, but added
                as a quick solution. In a real implementation, it should only create two
                of the same vertices so that the normals are not interpolated between
                the previous and next vertices that are connect to it).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="accounting-for-sharp-edges-other-curve-options">Accounting For
            Sharp Edges (other curve options)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Bezier curve (option 1), we can see that sharp edges are
                interpolated and creates an unpleasant image.
                <center>
                    <img src="./documentation/sharp_edge_correction/curve.png" alt="curve" width="300" />
                    <img src="./documentation/sharp_edge_correction/shape1.png" alt="shape" width="300" />
                    <img src="./documentation/sharp_edge_correction/shape2.png" alt="shape" width="300" />
                </center>
            </li>
            <li>The second view of image shows that the top of the object is
                actually flat. But looking at it from certain angles, it does not look
                flat. This is caused by normals being interpolated between the vertex on
                the top of the object and on the edge (Same applies to the lower part of
                the object).</li>
            <li>Added an option to account for sharp edges and create extra vertices
                if nesessary.
                <center>

                </center>
            </li>
            <li>Simple solution was, adding extra edges to the same vertex if the
                angle on that vertex is too harsh. This threshold can be adjusted
                (within the source code) to the user’s liking.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Changing <code>levelOfDetail</code> does not immediately update the
                object. Specifically it updates on the next <code>display3D()</code>
                callback.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cause: the <code>discreteCurvePoints</code> is only updated when
                        <code>Curve::draw()</code> is called. <code>glPostRedisplay()</code> is
                        called on the curve window and then the polygon is immediately recreated
                        and added to the buffer. Notice that the <code>reloadShape()</code> is
                        still using the old <code>discreteCurvePoints</code>. Then, GLUT runs
                        all the display callbacks, in which <code>discreteCurvePoints</code> is
                        actually updated with the new points.
                    </li>

            Refers to the following files: Curve.h, Curve.cpp, Bezier.h, Bspline.h, Bezier2.h, curve2.cpp.

            <h4>Modifications</h4>

            <p>
                Header files are modified. Specifically, the <code>Curve::draw()</code> functions now also take in <code>Pvector & discreteCurvePoints</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, the curve files (Curve.cpp and curve2.cpp) are modified to update <code>discreteCurvePoints</code> when <code>draw()</code> is called. Following functions are modified:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Curve::draw() @ Curve.cpp</code></li>
                    <li><code>Bezier::draw() @ curve2.cpp</code></li>
                    <li><code>Bspline::draw() @ curve2.cpp</code></li>
                    <li><code>Bezier2::draw() @ curve2.cpp</code></li>
                </ul>

        </details>

        <!--Shaders-->
        <details>
            <summary>Shaders</summary>
            reg.frag.glsl and reg.vert.glsl are added for the 3D Model Window. These are taken from hw2. The fragment shader is modified to just have one point light at the eye.
