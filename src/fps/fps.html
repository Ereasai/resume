    <h1>FPS Game</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        During my summer of 2023, I spent some of my free time learning and creating applications that uses openGL.
        I learned a lot of the basics, and really got deep into understanding many of the essential openGL concepts.
        During this process, I created a few (rough) projects.
        The one I will be showcasing here is a basic implementation of an FPS game. 
        The player can walk/run around and shoot cube targets.

        The main challenges of this project were:
        <ul>
            <li>implementing .obj parser</li>
            <li>implementing ray-boudingBox intersection (AABB)</li>
            <li>learning openGL</li>
            <li>implementing other abstractions like Camera, gameObject</li>
            <li>designing various animation behaviors of the player</li>
        </ul>
