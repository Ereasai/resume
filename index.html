    <h1>Who is Gunwoo</h1>


    <h2>Quick Introduction.</h2>

    <p>
        I'm Gunwoo.
        I am studying <b>Mathematics and Computer Science</b> @ <b>UCSD</b>.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Oh, I also minor in "music", formally known as <i>Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts Minor</i> @ UCSD.
    </p>



    <h2>Ouside of School.</h2>

    <p>
        Here are a few things I do when I am not pursuing my degree.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Play piano.</li>
        <li>Produce music, e.g. play with synthesizers, and do symphonic orchestral mockups.</li>
        <li>Learn random topics in math.</li>
        <li>Eat yummy food.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Experience.</h2>
    <p>
        I worked at McDonalds for 2 months, as a drive thru cashier.
        Honestly, this is one of the hardest things I've done in my life.
    </p>


    <h2>Projects.</h2>

    <p>
        Here are some projects.
        A lot of these are personal and self-motivated.
        Most of these projects also have documentation that you can look at.
        <i>I cannot share the source files of some of the projects because the school does not want me to publish it online.</i>

            <h3>Single Cycle CPU</h3>
            <p>
                I designed a very basic processor/computer with a limited knowledge of computer architecture.
                I saw this as a nice opportunities to test what I've learned in my digital logic class.

            <h3>SGCv0 (a CPU)</h3>
            <p>
                This is a project completed in a computer architecture class.
                We were tasked with a goal of designing a CPU, an assembler, and three software to be executed on our CPU.
                I built an webapp that can compile and simulate a custom ISA. See <b>section 7</b> of docs!
                This app played an significant role while debugging and ensuring correct behavior of our hardware.

            <h3>Raytracer</h3>
            <p>
                Created an image renderer that uses the raytracing technique.
                It was for a final project in introduction to computer graphics course.
                The program is able to parse geometry data and generate an image with correct lighting, softshadows, and camera properties. 
                Many of the features extended beyond the requirements of the assignment.

            <h3>Surface of Revolution</h3>
            <p>
                Created an interactive curve generator (Bezier, B-splines) and 3D surface of revolution renderer.
                This assignment was completed during my introduction to computer graphics course.
                The surface of revolution feature of the program was an extension of the original assignment.
                I've learned the basics of openGL 3.3+ programming.

            <h3>MCASM</h3>
            <p>
                A custom assembly language created to be used in Minecraft Java Edition.
                This is a project that I worked on with a friend of mine.
                The main motivation of this project was to achieve control flow within Minecraft, which was hard to do with vanilla features.
                Naturally, we created our own assembly language that would allow for branching logic and other useful features, like having variables and complex floating point operations.
                It was an peculiar use of our knowledge in compilers and programming language.

            <h3>Reflect (webapp)</h3>
            <p>
                A webapp created as a final product of a software development course.
                We learned various big concepts of software development such as Agile and unit testing.
                To make these ideas applicable, groups of students proposed and created a CRUD application.
                I lead a team of 10 in which I oversaw various subcomponents of the team and worked as a developer.

            <h3>fps game</h3>
            <p>
                Learned the basics openGL thoroughly and implemented an FPS game as an excercise.
                The player can walk/run around and shoot targets (cubes).
                I've heavily referenced learnOpenGL.
